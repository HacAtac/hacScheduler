//grabs from moment.js
var currentDay = moment().format('dddd MMMM do YYYY');
// calls the current day moment variable
$("#currentDay").text(currentDay);

//When I view time blocks they need to be color-coded for past,present,future


//When I click in time block then i can enter an event


//When I click the save button it saves it in local storage
//Posibly jQuery event listener in a function and then save time/text in local storage
//Need moment.js to get current hour moment().hour();
//need to loop over time blocks and check with conditional if < or = if, else if, if


//When I refresh the page the saved events are still there
